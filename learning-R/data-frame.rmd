## Defining Vectors
Firstly we begin by making data vectors.  
Vectors can be made simply as this example  
```{r}
names = c("Mohannad","Essam","Abood","Mafs")
school_marks = c(98,99,100,96)
qodorat_marks = c(98,94,96,91)
```

## Defining Data Frame
Data Frames are defined like this  
```{r}
students = data.frame(names,school_marks,qodorat_marks);
```
```{r echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
library(knitr)
kable(students)
```

## Making a new column with computed grades
```{r}
students$computed_grades = students$school_marks * 0.7 + students$qodorat_marks * 0.3
```
```{r echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
library(knitr)
kable(students)
```
